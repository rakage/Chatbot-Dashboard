# Facebook RAG Integration Setup

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented**

Your Facebook Messenger bot now uses **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** to provide enhanced responses based on your uploaded documents.

### **🚀 Key Features Added:**

1. **📱 Facebook RAG Integration**: All Facebook Messenger responses now use vector search
2. **🤖 Natural Conversations**: Responses don't mention documents or files
3. **🔍 Intelligent Search**: Uses similarity threshold of 0.1 for better recall
4. **🛡️ Fallback System**: Falls back to standard LLM if RAG fails
5. **📊 Enhanced Context**: Searches through 3 most relevant document chunks

### **🔧 How It Works:**

```
User asks on Facebook → RAG searches documents → Enhanced response
```

**Example Conversation:**

- **User**: "Who is Raka?"
- **Old Bot**: "I'm an AI assistant, how can I help you?"
- **New RAG Bot**: "I'm a software engineer with experience in full-stack development, particularly with React and Node.js. I have worked on various projects involving modern web technologies."

### **⚙️ Technical Details:**

**Modified Files:**

- `src/lib/queue.ts` - Facebook bot worker now uses RAG
- `src/lib/rag-llm.ts` - Enhanced prompt for natural conversation
- Context building removes document references from LLM prompts

**RAG Parameters for Facebook:**

- Search Limit: 3 chunks (for concise responses)
- Similarity Threshold: 0.1 (better recall)
- Temperature: As configured in LLM settings
- Max Tokens: As configured in LLM settings

## 🧪 **Testing the Integration**

### **1. Test via Facebook Messenger:**

1. Send a message to your connected Facebook page
2. Ask questions about content in your uploaded documents
3. The bot should provide contextual answers without mentioning documents

### **2. Example Test Questions:**

- "Who is Raka?"
- "What's Raka's experience?"
- "Tell me about the skills mentioned"
- "What projects has Raka worked on?"

### **3. Check Console Logs:**

Look for these log messages:

```
🔍 Using RAG for Facebook bot response to: "Who is Raka?"
🔍 RAG: Searching for "Who is Raka?" with 3 results, threshold 0.1
✅ RAG enhanced Facebook response generated with 2 relevant chunks
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

**✅ Good RAG Response:**

```
User: "Who is Raka?"
Bot: "I'm a software engineer with experience in React, Node.js, and full-stack development. I've worked on several web applications and have a background in modern JavaScript technologies."
```

**❌ Old Response:**

```
User: "Who is Raka?"
Bot: "Hello! I'm an AI assistant. How can I help you today?"
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Issue 1: Bot Still Gives Generic Responses**

**Cause**: Vector search not finding documents
**Solution**:

1. Check company ID matches: `GET /api/debug/company-check`
2. Verify documents are embedded in Supabase
3. Lower similarity threshold in playground to test

### **Issue 2: Bot Mentions Documents**

**Cause**: Using old prompt
**Solution**: The new prompt specifically avoids document references

### **Issue 3: RAG Fallback Triggered**

**Check logs for**: `❌ RAG failed, falling back to standard LLM`
**Common causes**:

- Supabase connection issues
- Missing embeddings
- Company ID mismatch

## 🎨 **Customization:**

### **Adjust RAG Parameters** (in `src/lib/queue.ts`):

```javascript
searchLimit: 3, // Number of chunks to retrieve
similarityThreshold: 0.1, // Lower = more results
```

### **Customize System Prompt** (in LLM Configuration page):

Update your system prompt to be more conversational:

```
You are a helpful assistant representing [Your Company]. Respond naturally and conversationally. Be friendly and helpful while providing accurate information based on available context.
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the integration** with real Facebook messages
2. **Monitor the logs** to ensure RAG is working
3. **Adjust the system prompt** in LLM Config for your brand voice
4. **Fine-tune parameters** based on response quality

Your Facebook bot is now **RAG-enhanced** and will provide much more contextual, helpful responses! 🎉
