# Facebook Bot Hallucination Fix

## üîç **Problem Identified**

The Facebook bot was hallucinating because it was using a different (weaker) system prompt compared to the playground, which was causing inconsistent behavior.

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause**

- **Playground**: Used RAG's enhanced anti-hallucination prompt
- **Facebook Bot**: Used `providerConfig.systemPrompt` from database (generic prompt)
- **Result**: Facebook bot made assumptions and added information not in context

## üõ°Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Unified Prompt System**

- Both Facebook and Playground now use the same enhanced RAG prompts
- Removed dependency on database `systemPrompt` for RAG responses
- Created specialized prompts for different contexts

### **2. Strict Facebook Prompt**

```
STRICT RULES:
1. ONLY USE PROVIDED CONTEXT: If information isn't in context, you don't know it. Period.
2. NO ASSUMPTIONS: Never fill gaps with general knowledge or assumptions.
3. NATURAL RESPONSES: Sound conversational, but stay factual.
4. BE HONEST: If you don't have specific information, say "I don't have that information"
5. NO SPECULATION: Don't extrapolate beyond what's explicitly stated.
```

### **3. Enhanced Temperature Control**

- **Facebook Bot**: Temperature capped at 0.2 (maximum consistency)
- **Playground**: Temperature capped at 0.3 (slightly more flexible)
- **Result**: More deterministic, factual responses

### **4. Better Context Handling**

- Cleaner context building without document references
- Stricter prompt structure for Facebook responses
- Enhanced debugging logs to monitor behavior

## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **Modified Files:**

1. **`src/lib/queue.ts`**: Facebook bot now uses strict RAG prompt
2. **`src/lib/rag-llm.ts`**: Added Facebook-specific prompt and temperature controls
3. **`src/app/api/rag/chat/route.ts`**: Playground uses enhanced prompt

### **Key Parameters:**

```javascript
// Facebook Bot
{
  systemPrompt: null, // Uses strict Facebook prompt
  temperature: Math.min(providerConfig.temperature, 0.2), // Capped at 0.2
  searchLimit: 3,
  similarityThreshold: 0.1,
  isFacebookBot: true // Triggers strict mode
}
```

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **Expected Behavior Now:**

**‚úÖ Good Facebook Response:**

```
User: "What programming languages do you know?"
Bot: "I have experience with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python."
```

**‚ùå Old Hallucinating Response:**

```
User: "What programming languages do you know?"
Bot: "I'm proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and I also work with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, which are common in full-stack development."
```

### **Debug Logs to Watch:**

```
üéØ RAG: Using STRICT Facebook prompt for query: "What languages do you know?"
üå°Ô∏è RAG: Temperature capped at 0.2 for Facebook
‚úÖ RAG enhanced Facebook response generated with 2 relevant chunks
```

## üéØ **Verification Steps**

1. **Test Facebook Bot:**

   - Ask: "What programming languages do you know?"
   - Should only mention languages explicitly in your CV
   - Should NOT add general assumptions about databases, etc.

2. **Compare with Playground:**

   - Ask same question in playground
   - Should get similar factual response
   - Both should avoid hallucination

3. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look for "STRICT Facebook" vs "Playground" prompt logs
   - Verify temperature is capped at 0.2 for Facebook

## üöÄ **Result**

Your Facebook bot should now:

- ‚úÖ **Stop hallucinating** - Only use information from your documents
- ‚úÖ **Be more accurate** - Strict adherence to provided context
- ‚úÖ **Stay conversational** - Natural tone without technical references
- ‚úÖ **Be honest about limitations** - Say "I don't have that information" when appropriate

The bot will now be much more reliable and trustworthy for your Facebook Messenger interactions! üéâ

## üìä **Monitoring**

Watch the console logs when testing:

- Facebook responses should show "STRICT Facebook prompt"
- Temperature should be capped at 0.2
- Responses should be more factual and less speculative

The hallucination problem should now be completely resolved! üõ°Ô∏è
